I am a working professional from Zimbabwe with diverse interests in entrepreneurship, software development, and community building. I enjoy delving into impactful work that requires problem-solving and creative thinking. My long-term goal is to use tech to help drive innovation and create opportunities for learning and wealth creation for people across the African continent.
