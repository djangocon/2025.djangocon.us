<p>Chris is a Technical Lead at InnoVint, where he builds APIs for winemakers. He’s been a software engineer for over a decade, specializing in API design, and has spent nearly as long immersed in the wine industry, developing tools for winemakers, working harvests at small-scale wineries, continually learning, and even making his own traditional method sparkling cider at home. He’s worked with Django since 2019 and recently merged his first contribution to the ORM. Outside of tech and wine, he enjoys ultimate frisbee, photography, and backpacking.</p>
