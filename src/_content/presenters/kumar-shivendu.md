Hi, I'm a Python and Rust engineer with a deep interest in search engines, AI, and open source. I started programming at 13 and have been working full-time as a software engineer for the past 3 years. I currently work for [Qdrant](https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant), the most loved OSS vector database.

Django has been a core part of my development journey and I've used it extensively across projects and organizations. I'm passionate about building open-source developer tools and sharing knowledge through talks on topics that matter to me.

Based in Bangalore (India), I enjoy discovering global cultures and cuisines.
