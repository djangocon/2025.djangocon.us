title: "Keynote: Django Reimagined For The Age of AI"
track: t0
---
22 years ago Django, was created in a newsroom by two programmers, Simon Willison and Adrian Holovaty. Since then, it's been downloaded millions of times and has one of the most active open source communities in Python. At the same time, the software industry has changed a lot because of AI, leaving many of us feeling unsure about the future of web development. In this talk we'll look at some of the key ideas that made Django successful in its early days, and how we can apply them today to reimagine how we create web applications with AI.

We'll talk about what it means to be a perfectionist working with non-deterministic tools like LLMs, how we can avoid repeating ourselves in the age of stochastic parrots and experiment with some live demos.
