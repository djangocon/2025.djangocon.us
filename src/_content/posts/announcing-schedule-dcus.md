We are beyond thrilled to unveil the 2025 DjangoCon US [talk and tutorial lineup](/schedule/). We'll have three days of talks on September 8-10, and two days of sprints on September 11-12.

We will have three keynote speakers which will be announced over the next several weeks. Stay tuned to our [Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@djangocon) and [news feed](/news/) for the announcements.

We have lots of great talks lined up, from talks about [Django for AI: Deploying Machine Learning Models with Django](/talks/django-for-ai-deploying-machine-learning-models-with-django/), [From Hype to Hard Truths: The Rise and Fall of Coding Boot Camps](/talks/from-hype-to-hard-truths-the-rise-and-fall-of-coding-boot-camps/), [Building maintainable Django projects: the difficult teenage years](/talks/building-maintainable-django-projects-the-difficult-teenage-years/), [Evolving Django: What We Learned by Integrating MongoDB](/talks/evolving-django-what-we-learned-by-integrating-mongodb/), [The Source of Change: Bettering Online Open Source Communities Can Begin with You](/talks/the-source-of-change-bettering-online-open-source-communities-can-begin-with-you/), [Djangonaut Space: A Mentorship Program For Open Source](/talks/djangonaut-space-a-mentorship-program-for-open-source/), and so much more!

Don't forget our awesome deep dive day, where we dig into things like [What a Decade!](/talks/what-a-decade/), [Free Threaded Django](/talks/free-threaded-django/), and [High Performance Django at Ten: Old Tricks & New Picks](/talks/high-performance-django-at-ten-old-tricks-new-picks/).

We'll also have lightning talks on all three days; you will sign up for those in Chicago. Details will be announced later.

If you haven't purchased your ticket yet, [you can get them here!](https://ti.to/defna/djangocon-us-2025).

As a reminder, the in person conference runs from September 8-12 in Chicago.

We hope to see you in Chicago!
