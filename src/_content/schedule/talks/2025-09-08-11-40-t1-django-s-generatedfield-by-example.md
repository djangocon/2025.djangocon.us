Database **generated columns** are a killer feature for Django and are now available in **Django 5.0** with the new `GeneratedField`.

The **value** of a `GeneratedField` is computed entirely by the **database** based on the other **fields** in the **model**, opening up very interesting usage scenarios.

In this talk, we will learn together how to use this field through various practical **examples**, using various Django supported **database backends**.
