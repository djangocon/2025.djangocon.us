# DjangoCon US 2025: Creating a Safe and Inclusive Community

As we gear up for another exciting DjangoCon US in Chicago this year, we want to take a moment to highlight one of the most important aspects of our conference: our **Code of Conduct**. At DjangoCon US, we believe that fostering a respectful, inclusive environment is essential to creating a valuable experience for everyone.

## Our Commitment to You

The **DjangoCon US 2025 Code of Conduct** serves as the foundation for how we interact with one another, both during the conference and in related online spaces. It's designed with one goal in mind: ensuring that every participant feels welcome, respected, and safe.

## What We Expect

Our community values **professional behavior, courtesy, and respect** among all attendees. This applies whether you're attending talks, participating in sprints, networking at social events, or engaging in conference-related online discussions.

Specifically, our code prohibits:

- **Harassment** in any form
- **Offensive language or jokes**
- **Unwelcome attention or advances**

We also ask that attendees be mindful about photography and recording - **always obtain permission** before capturing someone's image or voice.

## Reporting Concerns

If you experience or witness behavior that violates our Code of Conduct, we want to know about it. You can report incidents by emailing **conduct@djangocon.us** with detailed information about what occurred. Our team takes these reports seriously and will respond appropriately.

The conference organizers reserve the right to take action against anyone who violates these standards, which may include expulsion from the conference without a refund.

## A Note on Safety

For everyone's safety and peace of mind, **weapons are not permitted** at DjangoCon US events.

## Building on Strong Foundations

Our Code of Conduct was adapted from the Geek Feminism wiki and PyCon's Code of Conduct, reflecting best practices developed across the tech community.

## Join Us in Creating Something Special

DjangoCon US isn't just about technology—it's about people coming together to learn, share, and grow. By adhering to our Code of Conduct, you're helping us create an environment where everyone can participate fully and comfortably.

We're looking forward to welcoming you to Chicago for DjangoCon US 2025, where we'll celebrate not just Django, but the diverse, respectful community that makes it special.

*For complete details, please review our full [Code of Conduct](https://2025.djangocon.us/conduct/) before attending the conference.*
