Foxley is the go-to recruiter for the Django community in the United States. We specialise in helping Python and Django engineers find new roles with great companies. We’ll have live Python and Django Developer jobs open for applications throughout the conference, so come and talk to us if you’re ready for your next move.
Whether you’re exploring job opportunities, need hiring support, or just want some career advice, we’d love to chat.
As active members of the community and Silver Members of the Django Software Foundation, we’re committed to giving back, we donate a percentage of our profits each year to the DSF to support Django’s future.
