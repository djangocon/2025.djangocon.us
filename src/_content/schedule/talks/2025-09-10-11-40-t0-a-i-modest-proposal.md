It is a melancholy object to those who walk through these great tech landscapes, or travel in the Interwebs, when they see the apps, the websites, and repositories crowded with open source developers, followed by three, four, or six contributors, all with no jobs, and importuning every passenger for a job reference. These developers, instead of being able to work for their honest livelihood, are forced to employ all their time stroling to beg for sponsors for their helpless projects, who, as they grow more complex, turn into some rugpull SaaS app, or leave their dear open licenses, to work for the Pretender in Seattle, or sell themselves to the Bay.

I think it is agreed by all parties, that this prodigious number of contributors in the arms, or on the backs, or at the heels of open source maintainers, is in the present state of the tech industry, a very great grievance; and therefore whoever could find out a fair, cheap, and easy method of making these developers sound and useful members of the technosphere, would deserve so well of the public, as to have their NFT set up as a preserver of the Internet.
