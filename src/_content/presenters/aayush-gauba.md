I'm Aayush Gauba, a developer and security enthusiast who loves building systems that think. I work extensively with Django and machine learning to create practical tools that go beyond automationâ€”they learn, adapt, and evolve. Whether it's developing face recognition systems, experimenting with quantum-inspired AI, or building defense systems that block threats after a single attempt, I enjoy turning bold ideas into working code. I'm always exploring how to make the web smarter and safer. When I'm not coding, I'm usually testing unconventional ideas or refining something I built at 2 a.m.
