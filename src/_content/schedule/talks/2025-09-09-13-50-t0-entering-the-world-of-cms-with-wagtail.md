Content Management Systems are a crucial element of any organization's online presence in a world where customers get their information online. Depending on the content management system, you may encounter different challenges in completely different aspects. Whether it's the developers having a headache, the content writers having difficulty working with the content management system, or the customers having issues, does it have to be this way? 

Whether you're a veteran Django programmer, a new user of the framework, or a CMS developer exploring alternatives, this talk is for you. We'll demonstrate how Django and Wagtail can be leveraged to create an elegant, custom-tailored Content Management System. You'll learn how to build a CMS that's both easy to maintain for developers and intuitive for content writers, with customization options that perfectly align with your specific requirements.

Additionally, we will talk about the common pitfalls we see with CMS sites that run into issues and how to best prepare your CMS for running at scale.
