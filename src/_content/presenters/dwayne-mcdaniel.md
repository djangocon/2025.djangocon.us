Dwayne has been working as a Developer Advocate since 2014 and has been involved in tech communities since 2005. His entire mission is to “help people figure stuff out.” He loves sharing his knowledge, and he has done so by giving talks at hundreds of events worldwide. He has been fortunate enough to speak at institutions like MIT and Stanford and internationally in Paris and Iceland. Dwayne currently lives in Chicago. Outside of tech, he loves karaoke, live music, and crochet.
