title: 'High Performance Django at Ten: Old Tricks & New Picks'
track: t0
---

It’s been over a decade since I co-authored _High Performance Django_. The book helped thousands of developers understand how to build faster, more scalable Django applications.

This talk will revisit the techniques we recommended to see what’s aged like fine wine and what's aged like, well, milk. You’ll get an inside look at how Lincoln Loop manages Django applications that handle hundreds of millions of requests per month.

Topics covered will include:

* Caching
* Database Performance
* Monitoring and Observability
* Load Testing
* Third-Party Dependencies
* Infrastructure

This talk is best suited for intermediate to advanced Django developers who are already comfortable building their own apps and have a general understanding of deployments.
