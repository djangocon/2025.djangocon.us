Hey there! I'm Manish Tekam, a passionate software developer who's been riding the Django wave for over 2 years!
Currently, I'm part of the awesome team at Spotter AI, where I get to build cool stuff and solve interesting problems every day. My journey with Django has been like a great adventure - from writing my first "Hello World" to building complex web applications that make a real difference.
