SUMMARY:Django for AI: Deploying Machine Learning Models with Django
LOCATION:Sauganash Ballroom
DESCRIPTION:Presenter: Will Vincent\n\nIn this talk, we'll bridge the gap between AI/data science and web development by demonstrating how to first train and then deploy a machine learning model using Django. Starting with the classic Iris dataset, we'll walk through training a classification model with scikit-learn, covering key steps like data preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation.
 Once the model is trained, we'll shift focus to Django, showcasing how to integrate the model into a web application that allows users to input flower measurements and receive real-time predictions of the Iris species.
 You'll learn how to take a data science project from a Jupyter notebook to a fully functional Django web app in just a few steps. Whether you're a data scientist interested in web deployment or a Django developer exploring machine learning, this talk will equip you with the tools to bring machine learning models into production-ready applications.

SUMMARY:Easy, Breezy, Beautiful... Django Unit Tests
LOCATION:Wolf Point Ballroom
DESCRIPTION:Presenter: Colleen Dunlap\n\nWe’ve all been in a situation where test coverage was lacking. And unless you’ve been very lucky, we’ve all seen a situation where that lack of coverage led to bugs sneaking into production. With the complex backend and full-stack systems of today, it is unrealistic to expect any programmer to know exactly how a code change will affect all parts of the project. And we don’t have to! That’s why we have testing. And unit tests are the most accessible form of testing throughout the entire development process — it’s accessible right there in your terminal with a simple “pytest” or “make tests”. Unit tests are the first line of defense against bugs and breaks — let’s ensure you have a strong, reliable Alexander the Great of unit test suites and not a temperamental, vulnerable Achilles Heel!
 This talk is divided into two parts.
 Part One: Unit Testing Why, What and How — These topics will be called back to in Part Two when we talk about Django specific unit testing features.

LOCATION:Sauganash Ballroom
DESCRIPTION:Presenter: Rachell Calhoun\nPresenter: Tim Schilling\n\n&quot;Come for the language, stay for the community.&quot; This is a mantra of Python communities, including Django. It's clear how easy it is to forge a strong bond with people in our communities. But have you noticed when you solve one problem for the community, you're soon asked to help with two more problems? You might have even noticed that this phenomenon seems to never stop either. As long as you have time and energy, you're welcomed to do more and more for the community.
 Our communities and our contributors need boundaries. Open source software governance is one way to help raise those boundaries. Rachell and Tim want to share with you their lessons learned from their time as open source contributors and community organizers in various organizations in the Django community. Leaving this talk you will understand why governance is important to think about from the start, how to define a basic governance structure and how to integrate it into an existing community.

SUMMARY:Building a Wagtail CMS Experience that Editors Love
LOCATION:Wolf Point Ballroom
DESCRIPTION:Presenter: Michael Trythall\n\nWhen a website redesign is on the horizon, frustrations with the existing content management system (CMS) are often a major driver. Yet in many cases, the root problem isn't the CMS itself; it's how it was implemented.
 Wagtail CMS offers powerful tools for building rich, flexible content-driven websites, but without careful planning and thoughtful design, even the best technology can lead to editor frustration.
 In this talk, we'll explore strategies and best practices for modeling content and design systems in Wagtail CMS that prioritize the needs of editors and content teams. You'll learn how to structure StreamFields, Pages, and Design Systems to create intuitive, flexible, and scalable editing experiences. We'll cover tips for creating governance and patterns that evolve with a site over time, so your Wagtail builds not only launch successfully but also thrive for years to come.
 Whether you're a Django developer new to Wagtail or an experienced Wagtail user looking to level up...

SUMMARY:Deploy Django: GitOps & Kubernetes Made Easy
LOCATION:Sauganash Ballroom
DESCRIPTION:Presenter: Calvin Hendryx-Parker\n\nThis talk will show attendees how to streamline the day two operations of delivering and maintaining Python applications in production environments. It emphasizes GitOps principles, repeatable CI/CD workflows, and cloud-agnostic deployment using Kubernetes and Argo CD.
 Deploying code shouldn’t be stressful. But too often, the journey from local dev to production is fragile, manual, and hard to debug. This talk is about building peace of mind into your pipeline — with GitOps, Kubernetes, and open source tools like Argo CD that make continuous delivery predictable, repeatable, and scalable from the very first release to the 50th.
 We’ll tackle the realities of “day two” DevOps — what happens after the first deploy. From managing rollbacks and coordinating releases to enforcing consistency across dev, staging, and production, you’ll learn how to bring stability and scalability to your delivery pipeline.
 In a live demo, we’ll deploy a full stack Django app from GitHub to production us...

SUMMARY:Evolving Django: What We Learned by Integrating MongoDB
LOCATION:Wolf Point Ballroom
DESCRIPTION:Presenter: Jeffrey A. Clark\n\nHistory
 Building on the progress of the past, most notably django-mongodb-engine and django-nonrel, MongoDB has taken on the challenge of developing a production-ready Django database backend for MongoDB.
 Early in 2024 with help from Django core developer Tim Graham, MongoDB has systematically developed and tested a database backend with the potential to be greater than the sum of its parts.
 Present
 In September 2024, I started working for MongoDB to help with this project and what I've seen so far is amazing! - Query support with MongoDB's aggregate function. - A custom model manager with raw_aggregate function to support MongoDB's QuerySet language - Many more amazing things to be added between now and presentation! - Released our beta we urge folks to try!
 Future
 As a long time Django developer and newcomer to MongoDB, I am excited about the possibilities. - An alternative to PostgreSQL and MySQL! - Deployments to MongoDB's Atlas cloud database service. - Many more exciting...

SUMMARY:How to Enjoy Debugging in Production
LOCATION:Sauganash Ballroom
DESCRIPTION:Presenter: Karen Tracey\n\nAs developers, we go to great lengths to try to ensure our code is bug-free: automated code linters, code reviews, unit tests, and quality assurance testing on staging environments before production release. Despite our best efforts though, we still find bugs that only surface after release to production. In this talk, we'll draw on years of experience in supporting production sites to illustrate using real examples:
 
 Common reasons for bugs appearing in production, including
 
 Specifications at odds with reality
 Differences between development/testing and production environments
 
 
 Lessons learned from experience of encountering production bugs:
 
 How to guard against &quot;quiet&quot; failures (i.e. things not happening when they should)
 Methods / services to have in place to make debugging in production easier
 
 
 
 With the information presented in this talk, we hope you can approach your next launch day with more anticipation than dread!

SUMMARY:Peaceful Django Migrations
LOCATION:Wolf Point Ballroom
DESCRIPTION:Presenter: Efe Öge\n\nDjango’s migration framework is a powerful tool for evolving your database schema, but with great power comes great responsibility. In production systems, the wrong migration at the wrong time can introduce serious performance issues or even temporary outages.
 This talk demystifies what actually happens during makemigrations, migrate, and sqlmigrate, explains how Django interacts with the database engine, and highlights the locking behavior that can impact availability. Through real-world examples, we’ll explore schema changes that are especially risky—such as adding columns with defaults or modifying indexes—and how to spot them in advance using Django’s tools and external linters like Squawk.
 Attendees will leave with a practical toolkit of strategies for minimizing risk, including safe migration patterns, multi-step deployment techniques, and tips for planning changes during low-traffic windows. Whether you're running a high-traffic SaaS product or a growing internal tool, you'...

SUMMARY:Level Up Your Django Frontend: Integrate Web Components into Django Templates with Vue
LOCATION:Sauganash Ballroom
DESCRIPTION:Presenter: Mike Hoolehan\n\nHave you avoided heavyweight JavaScript frameworks because they're overwhelming, complicated, or difficult to integrate?
 Has your current JavaScript solution devolved into an unmaintainable, unscalable, and untestable mess?
 Need to bring real interactivity to your Django app but reluctant to commit to a full API-driven SPA?
 This talk is for you.
 In this 45-minute deep dive, you’ll learn how to bring modern frontend power to your Django app without giving up the simplicity of Django Templates. Starting with a simple Django-only dice-rolling app, I'll show you how to incrementally build and integrate interactive Web Components that bring the application to life.
 You’ll see how Vue 3.5, the Vite build tool, and Web Components make it fast and easy to add full-featured, maintainable interactivity to your template-driven Django apps.
 By the end of the talk, you'll understand how to:
 
 Create a new Vue project and configure the Vite build tool

 In this talk, I’ll walk through the real story behind ShotGeek: how casual group text arguments about NBA stats turned into an open-source Django application for tracking and comparing the performances of both current and retired NBA players. I’ll share:
 
 
 How the project got started and how I translated a playful idea into a real Django application.
 
 
 Technical challenges I faced (like designing flexible models for constantly evolving data).
 
 
 Lessons learned from encouraging community contributions and balancing “perfect code” with “good enough to move forward.”
 
 
 Insights into what went well—and what I wish I had done differently—as the project grew.
 
 
 How shared passions (in my case, basketball!) can create opportunities for real community and learning in open-source.

SUMMARY:Django Without Borders: A 10-Year Journey of Open Source Impact in Namibia
LOCATION:Wolf Point Ballroom
DESCRIPTION:Presenter: Ngazetungue Muheue\n\nIn this talk, I’ll share how we built one of Africa’s most impactful Python and Django communities in Namibia, focusing on the strategies and challenges we overcame to create a thriving, inclusive open-source ecosystem in a region with limited tech infrastructure. Attendees will learn howto grow a sustainable community, empowering underrepresented groups, and using open-source tools like Django to address local challenges in real-world projects.
 This talk is important because it highlights how communities in underserved regions can use open-source technologies to drive change, even without access to the infrastructure found in larger tech hubs. It’s a story of resilience, innovation, and collaboration over the last 10 years of our community. This journey wasn’t just about writing code; it was about changing the landscape of tech in Namibia, proving that with determination and the right support and tools like Django, anyone can participate and contribute meaningfully.

SUMMARY:PostgreSQL: Tuning parameters or Tuning Queries?
LOCATION:Sauganash Ballroom
DESCRIPTION:Presenter: Henrietta Dombrovskaya\n\nWhen it comes to database performance tuning, most PostgreSQL practitioners focus on optimizing configuration parameters. It is often assumed that as soon as we choose the correct values for parameters and restart the database instance, all the world's problems will be solved. Indeed, due to configuration parameters tuning, we can observe database performance increase up to 10-20% and sometimes up to 50%. That might sound like impressive numbers, but individual query optimization routinely makes queries run several times faster, sometimes ten or more times faster. All of us might recall some examples of such drastic performance improvement, but it is not easy to quantify the impact.
 In this talk, we will demonstrate the difference each approach can make with practical examples by using the Postgres_air database (https://github.com/hettie-d/postgres_air)- the largest publicly available PostgreSQL training DB. We will compare the impact of tuning different memory allocation parameter...

LOCATION:Sauganash Ballroom
DESCRIPTION:Presenter: Zags (Benjamin Zagorsky)\n\nEver thought &quot;I love Django but I can't use it on this project because [REASON]&quot;?  Let's take a second look.  Django has lots of parts, and it can still do a lot even if you don't use all of them.
 We're going to take Django apart and look at its pieces.  In the process, we'll look at new ways to use Django that you may have discarded as infeasible, including the following:
 
 When you have a lot of background and asynchronous tasks
 When you are using JavaScript frameworks for your frontend
 When you have a multi-service backend
 When you are using a database other than PostgreSQL or MySQL
 When you have no database
 When you aren't building a website
 When you have a lot of existing software not built in Django
 
 Throughout this talk, we'll look at how to use Django an appropriate amount for each situation, how Django can still be powerful even if you only use a few pieces of the framework, and things that could be added to Django for it to better address some of these ...

SUMMARY:Reverse engineering the QR code generator and URL forwarder service
LOCATION:Sauganash Ballroom
DESCRIPTION:Presenter: Mariatta\n\nSharing urls using QR code is a common use case nowadays.
 You might have seen restaurants sharing links to their menu or loyalty programs using QR code. A conference speaker might have lots of links to share during their talk, and it's not always practical to share long links in their presentation slides. Using QR code would help, but QR code creation is a mysterious process.
 There are various websites and services that lets you generate QR codes. However, these services sometimes aren't free, or they might serve ads on the website. What's even worse, sometimes these services would mask your url with a their own url shortener or domain. Users will hesitate to scan your QR code if it is not clear where it's taking them to.
 Let's reverse engineer those services and see how we can build our own using Python and Django.
 You can easily generate QR codes in Python using the qrcode Python library. It even lets you customize your QR code by adding colors and logo.

SUMMARY:Winemaking with Mutable Event Sourcing in Django
LOCATION:Wolf Point Ballroom
DESCRIPTION:Presenter: Chris Muthig\n\nEvent sourcing offers powerful advantages for traceability and domain modeling, but its strict immutability can become a constraint in domains where history needs revision. In this talk, we’ll explore how the complexities of winemaking led us to design a mutable event sourcing system, built with Django, that lets users correct and update the past while preserving consistency across the system. You’ll learn how we combined domain-driven design with a custom command model to add flexibility to an architecture that's traditionally rigid.

SUMMARY:Building maintainable Django projects: the difficult teenage years
LOCATION:Wolf Point Ballroom
DESCRIPTION:Presenter: Alex Henman\n\nRather than focusing on a single theme this talk touches on a range of real-world engineering problems and patterns, all centred around the challenges that arise in a mature codebase. Topics include:
 1. Cross-Framework Harmony with Custom Events and json_script
 Still stuck halfway through migrating to your new JavaScript framework 5 years later? (Just me?) I'll demonstrate a pattern which uses custom DOM events to keep things loosely coupled and how json_script can transmit structured data when you can't go all in on APIs.
 2. Customising DRF for more consistent APIs and Observability
 The Django REST Framework is powerful, but building standard patterns around it makes it even better. I’ll show how custom serializer fields and base viewsets can make data access consistent and enable things like automatic event tracking and monitoring endpoints.
 3. Taming Long-Running Queries with Postgres Statement Timeouts
 Long-running queries can kill user experience. By setting a statement_t...

SUMMARY:Beyond Filters: Modern Search (and more) with Vectors in Django
LOCATION:Wolf Point Ballroom
DESCRIPTION:Presenter: Kumar Shivendu\n\nTraditional search in Django apps, typically powered by queryset filters or keyword search, often fails to capture user intent. It matches exact words but misses meaning. Vector search solves this by representing the &quot;meaning&quot; of data (text, images, audio, video, etc) as high-dimensional vectors generated with ML models, enabling more relevant, personalized, and faster results.
 In this talk, you'll learn:
 
 When traditional search with Postgres or Elasticsearch falls short
 What vectors are, how vector search works, and when vector databases help
 How to integrate vector databases into your Django models using django-semantic-search
 A demo of &quot;More products like this&quot; feature with vectors in a Django e-commerce app
 Brief understanding of use cases beyond text search: multi-modal search, recommendations, content discovery, clustering, anomaly detection, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
 The trade-offs and limitations of vector search — when it helps an...

SUMMARY:Hidden Dangers Of AI In Developer Workflows: Navigating Security Risks with Human Insight
LOCATION:Sauganash Ballroom
DESCRIPTION:Presenter: Dwayne McDaniel\n\nAI tools like ChatGPT and Copilot have become indispensable in developers' daily workflows. Whether it is for code samples and scaffolding, prototyping, or documentation, AI can help eliminate a lot of toil from the developer's day-to-day.
 The hidden dangers that AI have introduced that are worth exploring.
 This presentation will look at the critical security challenges associated with AI-enhanced development workflows and the essential role of human oversight in mitigating these risks.
 We'll look into three major areas of concern:
 
 The AI told me to do it that way…
 Hallucinations everywhere
 Where did my data go?
 
 Join this talk to see some real examples of AI getting it wrong, but stay for a discussion on how you can leverage already existing tools to make the best use of the most valuable resource in the company…your team's time. Expect to leave with a fresh perspective on how bright a future we can build as people fostering more secure and efficient development practices.

SUMMARY:Beyond the ORM: from Postgres to OpenSearch
LOCATION:Sauganash Ballroom
DESCRIPTION:Presenter: Andrew Mshar\n\nOur team at Energy Solutions spent a year building a robust data ingestion and query pipeline using OpenSearch to provide centralized data to a distributed suite of applications. Along the way, we learned to question and rethink a lot of our relational database assumptions and take fuzzy search customization and accuracy to the next level. Meanwhile, we implemented Pydantic wrappers around JSON responses so we could continue to handle responses like native Python objects (along with other benefits we’ll discuss). We addressed long-standing challenges, such as:
 
 Improving the performance of the per-row create/update/delete paradigm (in one case, leading to a ~9x faster data ingest + load!)
 Putting OpenSearch “aliases” to work to help track current vs archival data
 Improving search relevancy
 PII exposure reduction
 
 In this presentation, we’ll walk through the decisions that led us to moving to an OpenSearch-based solution that works within a traditional Django framework, how we...

SUMMARY:Cutting latency in half: What actually worked—and what didn’t
LOCATION:Wolf Point Ballroom
DESCRIPTION:Presenter: Timothy Mccurrach\n\nJoin me as we dig into real-world Django performance challenges - from quick wins to stubborn bottlenecks that took multiple strategies to fix. Along the way, we’ll explore how we identified what really needed improving - and what was a red herring. We’ll walk through the code that caused the slowdowns, and examine the performance data to learn what actually made a difference.
 We’ll start with the often-overlooked topic of profiling, examining scenarios where our personal experience of the site didn’t match what the performance metrics were telling us. We’ll explore common mistakes in how performance is measured and why different goals require different metrics. Finally, we’ll compare the strengths and weaknesses of various profiling tools available - so you can better understand where your real opportunities for improvement lie.
 From there, we’ll learn what it means for querysets to be lazy, what an N+1 issue is, and the tools Django (and other third-party packages) provide to so...

Stories abound of mistreatment of project maintainers and community contributors, including bullying, doxing, even acts of outright violence. But those negative experiences don't have to happen! Creating a safe and welcoming environment for open source development begins with you. Discover how you can affect positive change in your own project space and the spaces of others within the open source community through practical and achievable actions. You will gain a better understanding of the problem, and the changes necessary to begin addressing it. Unfortunately, there may always be those who are not interested in being a part of this solution. You will learn ways to ensure you are able to take care of yourself within this reality, while breaking the pattern of negativity within the spaces willing to accept a positive change.

DESCRIPTION:Presenter: Lisa Dusseault\n\nThis talk will introduce the phaser open source library, but also teach principles that can help organizing data transformations and data pipelines.  It's hard to carve out time to build your own utilities for a data pipeline and it's hard to even know what are effective patterns for modularizing once code gets complicated.  Let's talk about why this investment is important and how the investment could be less costly.
 Topics will include
 
 Organizing data pipelines into more phases than just ETL, and why
 Using checkpoints and logging to be able to debug pipeline breakdowns after they occur
 Making data transformation code testable and maintainable
 Supporting a team or rotating contributors to data pipeline code

SUMMARY:Django as a Database Documentation Tool: The Hidden Power of Model Comments
LOCATION:Sauganash Ballroom
DESCRIPTION:Presenter: Ryan Cheley\n\nDocumentation is often the neglected aspect of database design, leading to confusion, mistakes, and lost institutional knowledge. With Django 4.2's comment features, your models can now serve as both code and documentation, synchronizing automatically with your database.
 In this practical session, I'll show you:
 
 How to use Django's column and table comments effectively
 Building unmanaged models to document existing databases
 Creating custom management commands for documentation reports
 Strategies for keeping documentation in sync across teams
 Integrating model comments with data dictionaries and other tools
 Using model introspection to generate documentation artifacts
 
 I'll demonstrate real-world examples of how these techniques have improved understanding of complex databases and reduced onboarding time for new team members. You'll leave with practical tools for improving your database documentation without maintaining separate documents.

SUMMARY:Python for Planet Earth: Climate Modeling and Sustainability in Action
LOCATION:Wolf Point Ballroom
DESCRIPTION:Presenter: Drishti Jain\n\nIn this talk, I'll delve into how Python is revolutionizing climate modeling and sustainability efforts. As the planet faces unprecedented environmental challenges, the need for precise data analysis and actionable insights has never been greater. Python, with its powerful libraries and tools, is at the forefront of this scientific revolution.
 I'll begin by exploring how Python is used in climate modeling, focusing on libraries like netCDF4 and xarray to handle and analyze complex climate datasets. Attendees will see how these tools enable scientists to simulate climate systems, predict future scenarios, and assess potential impacts on global and regional scales.
 Next, I'll shift to environmental monitoring, where Python plays a crucial role in processing and visualizing geospatial data. Using tools like Rasterio, GeoPandas, and PyProj, I'll demonstrate how Python facilitates real-time monitoring of environmental changes, such as deforestation, air quality, and ocean health.

Since then, it's been downloaded millions of times and has one of the most active open source communities in Python. At the same time, the software industry has changed a lot because of AI, leaving many of us feeling unsure about the future of web development. In this talk we'll look at some of the key ideas that made Django successful in its early days, and how we can apply them today to reimagine how we create web applications with AI.
 We'll talk about what it means to be a perfectionist working with non-deterministic tools like LLMs, how we can avoid repeating ourselves in the age of stochastic parrots and experiment with some live demos.

SUMMARY:A(i) Modest Proposal
LOCATION:Sauganash Ballroom
DESCRIPTION:Presenter: Mario Munoz\n\nIn 1729, Jonathan Swift presented an elegant and well thought-out solution to the problem of homelessness and poverty plaguing Ireland. He argued that his solution would result in a much more productive and fulfilling society. While not many could digest the meat of his proposal, it was still effective in exposing a widening gap of social inequality and abuse.
 Is it possible that Swift's proposal can be applied within our technosphere? Did he provide us with a recipe for success, or at least little nuggets of wisdom to chew on?
 Many attending this conference may be keenly aware of the dichotomy between open source and big tech. There is a relationship that always seems to be at risk of imploding. Should we be encouraging new (and existing) engineers to participate in open source, in spite of this tenuous relationship? If this topic whets your appetite, you'll definitely want to come to see what's cooking.

SUMMARY:Free Threaded Django
LOCATION:Sauganash Ballroom
DESCRIPTION:Presenter: Micah Lyle\n\nThis talk will likely have three or four major sections. Some of this is subject to change when we get out to ~1 to ~2 months from the conference given changes/breakthroughs in the Python free threading world, and any additional changes that are projected to happen in Python 3.14. That being said, here is the current outline:
 
 What is the GIL, and what are the positive and negative consequences of free threading and removing the GIL. What does the GIL protect against? What kind of bugs are &quot;impossible&quot; with the GIL that are now possible without it? And, given all of that, what does removing the GIL enable?
 If Django was in free threading mode (without the GIL), what parts of it and dependencies of it would likely be thread safe? What parts might not be thread safe, or would need some additional to work to become thread safe? We'll dive into various Django internals and demonstrate places that might need attention. We'll also look at database adapters like psycopg and ta...

SUMMARY:Automating initial deployments with django-simple-deploy
LOCATION:Sauganash Ballroom
DESCRIPTION:Presenter: Eric Matthes\n\nDeployment has been a sticking point for many Django developers as long as the framework has existed. With the 1.0 release of django-simple-deploy, that should no longer be the case. This release signifies a stable API, and most importantly a stable platform for building plugins.
 If you haven't seen django-simple-deploy in action, it lets you deploy a project in three steps. Assuming you have the target platform's CLI installed, here's what that looks like:
 $ pip install django-simple-deploy[&lt;platform_name&gt;]
 # Add django_simple_deploy to INSTALLED_APPS.
 $ python manage.py deploy --automate-all
 
 This currently works for Platform.sh, Fly.io, and Heroku. If you want a bit more control, you can separate out the configuration and deployment steps.
 The plugin ecosystem
 The core django-simple-deploy library only does a little work. It inspects your system and your project, and then hands off to an external plugin (such as dsd-platformsh) to take care of platform-specific conf...

LOCATION:Sauganash Ballroom
DESCRIPTION:Presenter: Timothy Allen\n\nContent Warning: This talk will dive into addiction and loss of friends due to addiction in the third section.
 2025 marks a decade that our team has been using Python and Django.
