title: 'Django Without Borders: A 10-Year Journey of Open Source Impact in Namibia'
track: t1
---

In this talk, I’ll share how we built one of Africa’s most impactful Python and Django communities in Namibia, focusing on the strategies and challenges we overcame to create a thriving, inclusive open-source ecosystem in a region with limited tech infrastructure. Attendees will learn howto grow a sustainable community, empowering underrepresented groups, and using open-source tools like Django to address local challenges in real-world projects.

This talk is important because it highlights how communities in underserved regions can use open-source technologies to drive change, even without access to the infrastructure found in larger tech hubs. It’s a story of resilience, innovation, and collaboration over the last 10 years of our community. This journey wasn’t just about writing code; it was about changing the landscape of tech in Namibia, proving that with determination and the right support and tools like Django, anyone can participate and contribute meaningfully. If you’re someone who’s interested in creating meaningful impact with technology, especially in resource-constrained environments, this talk will provide you with the lessons and strategies to do so.

I will discuss the following key points:

1. **Building an Open-Source Community**: How we engaged local and global partners, hosted events like Django Day Namibia, and created a space for developers to grow.
2. **Overcoming Challenges**: The unique obstacles we faced, from poor internet access to a lack of technical infrastructure, and how we found solutions that kept the community thriving for 10 years.
3. **Empowering Underrepresented Groups**: Our approach to inclusivity, especially focusing on mentoring women and students in tech.
4. **Real-World Impact**: Highlighting how we used Django in projects that addressed local issues like wildlife conservation, healthcare, and tourism.
5. **Sustaining a Community**: How we keep people motivated, engaged, and connected even with limited resources, and why our collective effort has been the key to staying active and relevant for the last 10 years.

This talk isn’t just for developers. It’s for anyone who believes in the potential of technology to uplift lives and communities, regardless of circumstances. Whether you’re a community organizer, a developer, or someone passionate about creating change, you’ll leave this session with both the inspiration and practical insights to make a difference where it matters most.
