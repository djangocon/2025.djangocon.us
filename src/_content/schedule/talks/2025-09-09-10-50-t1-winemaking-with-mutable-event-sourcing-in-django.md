title: Winemaking with Mutable Event Sourcing in Django
track: t1
---

Event sourcing offers powerful advantages for traceability and domain modeling, but its strict immutability can become a constraint in domains where history needs revision. In this talk, we’ll explore how the complexities of winemaking led us to design a mutable event sourcing system, built with Django, that lets users correct and update the past while preserving consistency across the system. You’ll learn how we combined domain-driven design with a custom command model to add flexibility to an architecture that's traditionally rigid.
