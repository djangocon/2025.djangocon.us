Meet Michael, an experienced System Administrator who has been working in the IT industry for 7 years. Presently, Michael works at Platform.sh as an Elite Cloud Support Engineer, working with Platform's Elite tier customers, typically consisting of big brands. Michael has used Python to approach or create solutions to big problems throughout his career.
