I'm a Django/Python developer who has become very involved in the Django community over the past few years. I started by helping maintain the django-debug-toolbar library and have started helping in other areas, including Djangonaut Space, Django Commons, and the Django Steering Council. I also was a DEFNA director and a DjangoCon US organizer. Beyond community organizing I like to bake bread, brew beer, ferment hot sauce and as of 2025, roast coffee. If you see me around, come say hi!
