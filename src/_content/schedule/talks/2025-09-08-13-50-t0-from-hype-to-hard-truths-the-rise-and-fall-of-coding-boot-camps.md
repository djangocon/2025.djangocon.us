title: 'From Hype to Hard Truths: The Rise and Fall of Coding Boot Camps'
track: t0
---

Coding boot camps reshaped tech education, offering an intensive, fast-track path into software development that brought thousands of new developers into the industry—including myself. But as quickly as they rose, many boot camps faltered, leaving students, instructors, and the broader tech community grappling with tough questions about their long-term impact.

This talk is structured into three parts:

The Rise—We’ll examine boot camps' early success, highlighting their innovative teaching methods, focus on outcomes, and ability to bring new voices into tech.

The Fall – Next, I’ll unpack the challenges that led to their decline, from unsustainable business models to widening equity gaps and unfulfilled promises.

The Lessons – Finally, we’ll discuss how the Django community can apply these hard-learned lessons to create more inclusive, sustainable ways of onboarding and mentoring new developers.

This talk combines personal stories with broader industry insights, giving attendees a clear view of how we can build on boot camps' successes while avoiding their pitfalls. Whether you’re an educator, mentor, or hiring manager, this session will leave you with actionable ideas to better support the next generation of Django developers.
