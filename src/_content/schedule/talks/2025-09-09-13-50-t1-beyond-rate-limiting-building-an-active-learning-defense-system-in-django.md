title: 'Beyond Rate Limiting: Building an Active Learning Defense System in Django'
track: t1
---

What if your Django app could defend itself and get smarter over time? In this talk, we'll dive into AIWAF, an open-source, Django-native firewall that learns from real web traffic to catch suspicious behavior like 404 floods, probing attacks, and UUID tampering. You'll learn how easy it is to plug AIWAF into your project and build a self-adapting defense system without needing a full security team.
