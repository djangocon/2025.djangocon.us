      <p>Hello Djangonauts!</p>
<p>DjangoCon US is coming up, and our excitement is building.</p>
<p>Weâ€™re spending a little time getting to know people who will be attending DjangoCon US this September. We asked various people who have different connections and experiences with the Django community.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/apoorv-garg-/">Apoorv Garg</a> is a first-time attendee at DjangoCon US</li>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/richel-agyemang-468379211/">Richel Agyemang</a> is a first-time organizer</li>
<li><a href="https://fosstodon.org/@kati">Katherine &quot;Kati&quot; Michel</a> is a long-time attendee, speaker and organizer of DjangoCon US</li>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kudzayi-bamhare-3b6991b7/">Kudzayi Bamhare</a> is a first-time speaker</li>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathan-zeager/">Nathan Zeager</a> is a board member of DEFNA and DjangoCon US organizer</li>
</ul>
<p>So letâ€™s get to meeting them!</p>
<p><em>Note, the remainder of the post switches to first person from the perspective of Velda,</em> <a href="https://www.defna.org/"><em>DEFNA</em></a> <em>director and DjangoCon US 2025 organizer.</em></p>
<p><strong>Interviewer Velda</strong>:</p>
<p>Hello, thanks for agreeing to this. Letâ€™s start with having you tell us a little about yourself and your connection to the Django community.</p>
<p><strong>Apoorv</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am Apoorv Garg, Technical Lead at InnerGize, previously worked as a Software engineer at Wells Fargo, Talkdoc, Resilient AI and Deloitte. Beyond my professional experience, I am a technical steering committee member for <a href="https://jderobot.github.io/">JdeRobot</a>, an open source organization in Spain, creating an open source toolkit for robotics applications.</p>
<p>I have delivered talks on <a href="https://pycon.org/">PyCon US 2025</a> and <a href="https://2025.djangocon.eu/">DjangoCon Europe 2025</a> about Carbon footprint from Python Program, observability and monitoring of Django applications using Prometheus and Grafana. I recently joined Django Community as an Individual member at<a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/"> Django Software foundation</a> and working as a mentor in Django for <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/">Google Summer of Code Program 2025</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Richel</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi, Iâ€™m Richel Agyemang, a Ghanaian and a recent graduate in <a href="https://knustportal.com/knust-bsc-disability-and-rehabilitation-studies/">Disability and Rehabilitation Studies from KNUST</a>. Iâ€™m passionate about inclusive technology, accessibility, and using design to make a real impact. My journey into tech started from a desire to bridge the gap between disability and digital inclusion, and that led me into UX design.</p>
<p>As I learned more, I discovered <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> while exploring <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> for web development. I was drawn to how clean and powerful it is and was even more impressed by the kindness and support within the community. I didnâ€™t want to just learn from afar, so I joined the <a href="https://2025.djangocon.us/">DjangoCon US 2025</a> team as a volunteer. I currently help with graphic design where I have been creating flyers and graphics for the event and itâ€™s been an amazing experience working with such a thoughtful and inclusive team.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Kati</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am a Python/Django software engineer at <a href="https://www.jpmorganchase.com/">JPMorganChase</a>. I became interested in <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> and open-source code in 2013, and stumbled upon <a href="https://2025.djangocon.us/">DjangoCon US</a> through its website code hosted on <a href="https://github.com/djangocon/2025.djangocon.us">GitHub</a>. I became a DjangoCon US volunteer in 2016 and served as website chair or co-chair from 2017 to 2020. In 2017, I became a <a href="https://www.defna.org/">Django Events Foundation North America (DEFNA)</a> Board Member.</p>
<p>During my eight+ years as a board member, I served as corporate secretary from 2020 to 2022 and took great enjoyment in collaborating on the DjangoCon US website design every year. I frequently attend <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> and <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> conferences, make connections in person and online, and share what I've learned through conference recaps.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Kudzayi</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sure, my name is Kudzayi Bamhare, and I am a passionate coder, teacher, and community leader from Harare, Zimbabwe. My connection to Django began when I attended <a href="https://na.pycon.org/">PyCon Namibia</a> in 2023, where I met some incredible friends who were planning to attend the first <a href="https://2025.djangocon.africa/">DjangoCon Africa</a>at the end of the year in Zanzibar.</p>
<p>Not wanting to miss out, I dedicated the rest of the year to learning <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> and managed to build some fun projects along the way. Fast forward a few years, and I have now attended all three major <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>)conferences, contributed to <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Djangoâ€™s</a>) documentation, and even helped organise a few DjangoCons.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Nathan</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I attended <a href="https://momentum.org/">Momentum Learningâ€™s software development program</a>, where we used <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> and <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> for our backend work. Last year I was an organizer at <a href="https://2025.djangocon.us/">DjangoCon US</a> and was really impressed with the conference. This year I joined <a href="(https://www.defna.org/)">DEFNA</a> as a board member to continue contributing to the community.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Interviewer Velda</strong>:</p>
<p>That's cool! Can you please share what you are looking forward to at DjangoCon US 2025?</p>
<p><strong>Apoorv</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I recently joined as a technical lead at a startup called InnerGize, I am looking forward to meeting leaders in technology on how they have created an impact in this role and learn from them. One thing that I always look for in conferences is to make new connections, learn from them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Richel</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Iâ€™m excited about the talks, especially those focused on accessibility and community building. I canâ€™t wait to learn from others, hear their stories, and be inspired by the creative ways people are using Django to make a difference. Iâ€™m really looking forward to connecting with people from all kinds of backgrounds who are passionate about open source, design, and inclusion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Kati</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am most looking forward to leveling up my knowledge. I enjoy learning about the latest features implemented by Django fellows and volunteers, and other deep dives. I am also excited that the conference will be held in downtown Chicago this year. It will be an amazing location!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Kudzayi</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's quite difficult to choose just one thing, but I have to say that I'm really looking forward to reconnecting with everyone from the Django community. I'm excited to hear all the great talks, attend sprints, and visit Chicago as well, but the best part of any conference experience is the people who make it special. You'll definitely want to stick around for the connections you can make at DjangoCon US!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Nathan</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Iâ€™m looking forward to meeting back up with everyone from last year and making new friends in the community.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Interviewer Velda</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whatâ€™s one tip or trick you would share with someone attending their first tech conference?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Apoorv</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>PAC MAN RULE - I learned this rule from a recent conference. If talking in a circle, always leave a space for one more person in that circle, creating more inclusive and welcoming spaces.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Richel</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Be curious, and donâ€™t be afraid to talk to people! Introduce yourself, ask questions, take notes, and be open to learning from everyone you meet because never know<br>
what kind of collaborations or friendships might come out of it. And donâ€™t forget to take breaks when you need them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Kati</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Seize the day! Set aside any shyness or doubts. Go up to the author you've always admired and chat for a bit. Sit with different people at every meal. Connect with a prospective employer. Learn about a new topic that inspires you. Take time to enjoy some once-in-a-lifetime food and sight-seeing in the host city.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Kudzayi</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Iâ€™m cheating, but Iâ€™m going to share two key tips: plan your schedule and pace yourself! Conferences can become overwhelming with so many people, talks, and workshops happening simultaneously; itâ€™s easy to get lost in the hustle and bustle. I recommend reviewing the conference schedule in advance. Identify the events that you absolutely donâ€™t want to miss and carve out time to grab coffee with a friend or introduce yourself to new people at the conference.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Nathan</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Donâ€™t feel that thereâ€™s one right way to participate in the conference, focus on what feels right for for you (attending talks, meeting new people, coding and asking for help, etc.) Thereâ€™s no right way to participate and youâ€™ll come away feeling more energized if you listen to your needs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Interviewer Velda</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whatâ€™s one word that best describes DjangoCon US (or your feelings leading up to it)?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Apoorv</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>20 years / 2 Decades</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Richel</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Empowering</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Kati</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Empowerment. DjangoCon US is what you make of it, and the opportunities are endless. My involvement with DjangoCon US has been life changing. It has grown my network, knowledge, and opened doors for me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Kudzayi</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Excited!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Nathan</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Community</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Interviewer Velda</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What made you decide to attend DjangoCon US?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Apoorv</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am volunteering this year at DjangoCon US, working in the program committee. So I wanted to gain experience on the volunteering parts, what all things you need to keep in your mind when organizing such big events. And Trust me, It ain't all easy but at the same time it is fun.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Interviewer Velda</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What are you hoping to take back to your local community?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Interviewer Velda</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What are your expectations going into your first DjangoCon US?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Apoorv</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am expecting it to be fun and enjoying 2 decades of Django with the community.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Interviewer Velda</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What are you hoping to take back to your local community?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Apoorv</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am working with the <a href="https://www.djangoindia.org/home">Django India Community</a> to organize DjangoDay India (smaller than a conference, bigger than a meetup). I aim to take my learnings from DjangoCon US to help make me a better organizer.</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- Richel -->
<p><strong>Interviewer Velda</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What surprised you most about the behind-the-scenes of organising a conference?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Richel</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I was surprised by how much teamwork and careful planning goes into every part of the event. From speaker review to website building to grant review to designing<br>
graphics, itâ€™s clear that every small detail matters. Being behind the scenes has shown me how deeply the team cares about making DjangoCon US inclusive, welcoming, and meaningful for everyone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Interviewer Velda</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What part of organising DjangoCon US has been the most rewarding so far?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Richel</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The most rewarding part has been seeing my design work go out into the world and be appreciated by the community. Itâ€™s amazing to know that Iâ€™m contributing to<br>
something bigger; an event that brings people together and creates a positive impact.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Interviewer Velda</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What advice would you give to someone thinking about volunteering or organising?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Richel</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Go for it! You donâ€™t have to have it all figured out. Volunteering helps you learn, meet amazing people, grow your confidence, and discover skills you didnâ€™t know<br>
you had. Just be willing to help and stay open and you will be surprised how much you will gain.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Interviewer Velda</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How has DjangoCon US changed over the years?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Kati</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By design, DjangoCon US has become substantially more diverse. It has been great to see the number of women and Black attendees increase over the years. Everyone is welcome and everyone makes it a better place. Here are a few important milestones. In 2016, the number of women speakers was nearly 50%. In 2017, three women of color keynoted. In 2023, the conference was an important platform for the newly formed <a href="https://blackpythondevs.com/index.html">Black Python Devs</a> organization. By one organizer's count, we had around 10 Black speakers, and a Django Girls workshop had a majority of Black participants. In 2024, the conference hosted the Black Python Devs Leadership Summit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Interviewer Velda</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What keeps you coming back?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Kati</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The community keeps me coming back. DjangoCon US is often called &quot;the conference with heart.&quot; I have met so many kind, supportive, inspiring people through the conference. I am forever grateful for the many friendships I have made.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Interviewer Velda</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whatâ€™s one unforgettable moment or conversation youâ€™ve had at DjangoCon US?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Kati</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not only was DjangoCon US 2017 the first conference that I ever attended, it was my first time ever giving a conference talk! Looking back, I still marvel that I had the courage to get up on that stage and teach a crowd of strangers what I had learned as the conference website chair that year. DjangoCon US loves to be remembered as the place that started speaking careers. Taking that leap of faith was a pivotal moment for me.</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- Kudzayi -->
<p><strong>Interviewer Velda</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What inspired you to submit a talk to DjangoCon US?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Kudzayi</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I had two main reasons for submitting a talk to DjangoCon US this year. Firstly, to fulfil my personal goal of speaking at all three major Django conferences - Iâ€™m happy to say I'll be two out of three by the end of the year! Second, at the end of last year, I set another goal to turn my NBA stat-tracking and comparison web application, <a href="https://www.shotgeek.com/">ShotGeek</a>, into an open-source project and present it at various Django and Python conferences in 2025. DjangoCon US was at the top of my list, so Iâ€™m really proud that my talk was accepted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Interviewer Velda</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What are you most nervous or excited about when it comes to speaking?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Kudzayi</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I know this might sound a bit unusual, but Iâ€™m looking forward to the nervous rush that comes with public speaking; it really makes me feel alive, and I enjoy it haha! I'm also excited and a little nervous about sharing the stage with so many amazing people in the Django community. Their presence motivates me to work hard and prepare an engaging talk.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Interviewer Velda</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What advice would you give to someone considering submitting a talk next year?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Kudzayi</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Donâ€™t overthink it and just go for it! As humans, we often set limitations on ourselves and our capabilities. But I've realised that life rewards those who take risks and say &quot;yes&quot; to new opportunities. Take it one step at a time. If you're considering submitting a talk, that's fantastic! Focus on what you want to discuss, start putting together your proposal, and worry about speaking on stage later. Once your talk is accepted, youâ€™ll have access to a supportive community, including DjangoCon US speaker mentors, who will assist you in preparing for your big day. Remember, everyone is figuring it out as they go, so thereâ€™s no point in being the one who gets stuck overthinking!</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- Nathan -->
<p><strong>Interviewer Velda</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How do you keep DjangoCon US aligned with community values?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Nathan</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are countless opportunities, but one that is important to me is consistently working to make DjangoCon US accessible to more people. One thing that struck me my first year at the conference is how welcoming everyone is to people, like myself, who have limited to no experience with Django. Itâ€™s my hope that each year of the conference finds new ways to be accessible, and that the community feels comfortable giving feedback on how we could do better.</p>

<p>Whatâ€™s been the biggest challenge (or lesson) as a repeat organiser?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Nathan</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a repeat organizer I want to bring lessons I learned from last year, but also make space for other organizers to step up and gain experience.</p>

<p><strong>Interviewer Velda</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whatâ€™s your proudest moment from a past DjangoCon US?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Nathan</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Watching the hackathon participants present the work they got done in just one week. It was very impressive! I was excited that people wanted to participate and it was fun to be there and support everyone in their accomplishments.</p>
