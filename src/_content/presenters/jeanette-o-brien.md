With over seven years of experience in front-end development and UX design, I now focus on developer advocacy, championing best practices and fostering engagement—especially within the Django ecosystem. I’ve collaborated with teams at Caktus Group and Ansible by Red Hat, building scalable, user-friendly applications using Python, JavaScript, and modern frameworks like Django and React. Passionate about making technology more accessible, I create resources, lead discussions, and support developers in creating impactful software.

Outside of coding, I’m highly committed to mentorship and community building. As the Director of Women Who Code Raleigh-Durham, I organize workshops and networking events designed to empower women in tech. In my spare time, you’ll find me gaming or exploring digital illustration—creative outlets that energize my problem-solving mindset and keep me inspired. Whether through code, art, or community initiatives, I enjoy connecting with others who share a passion for technology and innovation.
