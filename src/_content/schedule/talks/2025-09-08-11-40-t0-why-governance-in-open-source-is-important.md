"Come for the language, stay for the community." This is a mantra of Python communities, including Django. It's clear how easy it is to forge a strong bond with people in our communities. But have you noticed when you solve one problem for the community, you're soon asked to help with two more problems? You might have even noticed that this phenomenon seems to never stop either. As long as you have time and energy, you're welcomed to do more and more for the community.

Our communities and our contributors need boundaries. Open source software governance is one way to help raise those boundaries. Rachell and Tim want to share with you their lessons learned from their time as open source contributors and community organizers in various organizations in the Django community. Leaving this talk you will understand why governance is important to think about from the start, how to define a basic governance structure and how to integrate it into an existing community. Our goal is to raise awareness around the need for clearer expectations so people feel more confident contributing and feel less guilty when they can't.
