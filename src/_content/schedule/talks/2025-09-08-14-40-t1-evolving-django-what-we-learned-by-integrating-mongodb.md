## History

Building on the progress of the past, most notably django-mongodb-engine and django-nonrel, MongoDB has taken on the challenge of developing a production-ready Django database backend for MongoDB.

Early in 2024 with help from Django core developer Tim Graham, MongoDB has systematically developed and tested a database backend with the potential to be greater than the sum of its parts.

## Present
In September 2024, I started working for MongoDB to help with this project and what I've seen so far is amazing! - Query support with MongoDB's aggregate function. - A custom model manager with raw_aggregate function to support MongoDB's QuerySet language - Many more amazing things to be added between now and presentation! - Released our beta we urge folks to try!

## Future
As a long time Django developer and newcomer to MongoDB, I am excited about the possibilities. - An alternative to PostgreSQL and MySQL! - Deployments to MongoDB's Atlas cloud database service. - Many more exciting things to be added between now and presentation!
